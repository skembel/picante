\description{
Calculate the bounded phylogenetic biodiversity metrics: phylogenetic
species variability, richness, evenness and clustering for one or multiple
samples.
}
\details{
\emph{Phylogenetic species variability (PSV)} quantifies how phylogenetic
relatedness decreases the variance of a hypothetical unselected/neutral
trait shared by all species in a community. The expected value of PSV is
statistically independent of species richness, is one when all species in a
sample are unrelated (i.e., a star phylogeny) and approaches zero as
species become more related. PSV is directly related to mean phylogenetic
distance, except except calculated on a scaled phylogenetic covariance
matrix. The expected variance around PSV for any sample of a particular
species richness can be approximated.  To address how individual species
contribute to the mean PSV of a data set, the function \code{psv.spp} gives
signed proportions of the total deviation from the mean PSV that occurs
when all species are removed from the data set one at a time. The absolute
values of these \dQuote{species effects} tend to positively correlate with
species prevalence.  \cr \cr \emph{Phylogenetic species richness (PSR)} is
the number of species in a sample multiplied by PSV. It can be considered
the species richness of a sample after discounting by species relatedness.
The value is maximum at the species richness of the sample, and decreases
towards zero as relatedness increases. The expected variance around PSR for
any sample of a particular species richness can be approximated.  \cr \cr
\emph{Phylogenetic species evenness (PSE)} is the metric PSV modified to
incorporate relative species abundances. The maximum attainable value of
PSE (i.e., 1) occurs only if species abundances are equal and species
phylogeny is a star. PSE essentially grafts each individual of a species
onto the tip of the phylogeny of its species with branch lengths of zero.
\cr \cr \emph{Phylogenetic species clustering (PSC)} is a metric of the
branch tip clustering of species across a sample's phylogeny. As PSC
increases to 1, species are less related to one another the tips of the
phylogeny. PSC is directly related to mean nearest neighbor distance.
}
\note{
These metrics are bounded either between zero and one (PSV, PSE, PSC)
or zero and species richness (PSR); but the metrics asymptotically approach
zero as relatedness increases. Zero can be assigned to communities with
less than two species, but conclusions drawn from assigning communities
zero values need be carefully explored for any data set. The data sets need
not be species-community data sets but may be any sample data set with an
associated phylogeny.
