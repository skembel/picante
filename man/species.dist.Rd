\title{Species co-occurrence distances}
\usage{
species.dist(x, metric = c("cij", "jaccard", "checkerboard", "doij"))
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Community data matrix}

\item{metric}{Co-occurrence metric to use (see Details section for
description)}
}
\value{
A \code{dist} object with co-occurrences among all species pairs
}
\description{
Compute interspecific distances based on patterns of species co-occurrence
in communities.
}
\details{
Currently implemented co-occurrence measures (arguments to metric):
\describe{ \item{cij}{ Schoener's index of co-occurrence } \item{jaccard}{
Jaccard index of co-occurrence } \item{checkerboard}{ Checkerboard index of
co-occurrence } \item{doij}{ DOij index of co-occurrence } }
