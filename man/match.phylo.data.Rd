\title{Match taxa in phylogeny and data}
\usage{
match.phylo.data(phy, data)
}
\arguments{
\item{phy}{A phylogeny object of class phylo}

\item{data}{A data object - a vector (with names matching phy) or a
data.frame or matrix (with row names matching phy)}

\item{comm}{Community data matrix}

\item{dis}{A distance matrix - a dist or matrix object}
}
\value{
A list containing the following elements, pruned and sorted to
match one another: \item{phy}{ A phylogeny object of class phylo }
\item{comm}{ Community data matrix } \item{data}{ A data object (vector,
data.frame or matrix) } \item{dist}{ A distance matrix - a dist or matrix
object }
}
\description{
These functions compare taxa present in phylogenies with community or trait
data sets, pruning and sorting the two kinds of data to match one another
for subsequent analysis.
}
\details{
A common pitfall in comparative analyses in R is that taxa labels are
assumed to match between phylogenetic and other data sets. These functions
prune a phylogeny and community or trait data set to match one another,
reporting taxa that are missing from one data set or the other.

Taxa names for phylogeny objects are taken from the phylogeny's tip labels.
Taxa names for community data are taken from the column names. Taxa names
for trait data are taken from the element names (vector) or row names
(data.frame or matrix). Taxa names for distance data are taken from
column/row names of the distance matrix/dist object.

If community data lack taxa names, the function will issue a warning and no
result will be returned, since the community-phylogenetic analyses in
\code{picante} require named taxa in the community data set.

If trait data or distance matrix lack names, a warning is issued and the
data are assumed to be sorted in the same order as the phylogeny's tip
labels or community's column labels.

These utility functions are used by several functions that assume taxa
labels in phylogeny and data match, including \code{\link{Kcalc}},
\code{\link{phylosignal}}, and \code{\link{raoD}}.
