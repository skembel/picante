\title{Species' evolutionary distinctiveness}
\usage{
evol.distinct(
  tree,
  type = c("equal.splits", "fair.proportion"),
  scale = FALSE,
  use.branch.lengths = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{tree}{an object of class phylo}

\item{type}{a) equal splits (Redding and Mooers 2006) or b) fair
proportions (Isaac et al., 2007)}

\item{scale}{The scale option refers to whether or not the phylogeny should
be scaled to a depth of 1 or, in the case of an ultrametric tree, scaled
such that branch lengths are relative.}

\item{use.branch.lengths}{If use.branch.lengths=FALSE, then all branch
lengths are changed to 1.}
}
\description{
Calculates evolutionary distinctiveness measures for a suite of species by:
a) equal splits (Redding and Mooers 2006) b) fair proportions (Isaac et
al., 2007). Returns a datafram with species identifiers and species scores.
}
\note{
This function will return a vector of evolutionary distinctivenss for
every species in the given tree. If only a subset of values are needed
there are two, concetually distinct options: either prune the tree first
and then pass the tree in or subset the resulting vector.  These two
options will provide very different outputs.
