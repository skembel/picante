\usage{
pd(samp, tree, include.root = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{samp}{Community data matrix}

\item{tree}{A phylo tree object}

\item{include.root}{Should the root node be included in all PD calculations
(default = TRUE)}
}
\value{
Returns a dataframe of the PD and species richness (SR) values for
all samples
}
\description{
Calculate the sum of the total phylogenetic branch length for one or
multiple samples.
}
\note{
The data sets need not be species-community data sets but may be any
sample data set with an associated phylogeny. PD is not statistically
independent of species richness, it positively correlates with species
richness across samples. The function \code{\link{ses.pd}} compares
observed PD to the values expected under various randomizations and allows
a way to standardize for unequal richness across samples.

If the root is to be included in all calculations of PD
(\code{include.root=TRUE}), the tree must be rooted. Single-species samples
will be assigned a PD value equal to the distance from the root to the
present.

If the root is not included in all calculations by default
(\code{include.root=FALSE}), the tree need not rooted, but in the case of
single-species samples the PD will be equal to NA and a warning will be
issued.
}
\section{Warning }{
 If the root is to be included in all calculations
(\code{include.root=TRUE}), the PD of all samples will include the branch
length connecting taxa in those samples and the root node of the supplied
tree. The root of the supplied tree may not be spanned by any taxa in the
sample. If you want the root of your tree to correspond to the most recent
ancestor of the taxa actually present in your sample, you should prune the
tree before running \code{pd}:

\code{prunedTree <- prune.sample(sample,tree)}
}
