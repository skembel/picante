\description{
Calculates Rao's quadratic entropy, a measure of within- and
among-community diversity taking species dissimilarities into account
}
\details{
Rao's quadratic entropy (Rao 1982) is a measure of diversity in ecological
communities that can optionally take species differences (e.g. phylogenetic
dissimilarity) into account. This method is conceptually similar to
analyses of genetic diversity among populations (Nei 1973), but instead of
diversity of alleles among populations, it measures diversity of species
among communities.

If no phylogeny is supplied, Dkk is equivalent to Simpson's diversity
(probability that two individuals drawn from a community are from different
taxa), Dkl is a beta-diversity equivalent of Simpson's diversity
(probability that individuals drawn from each of two communities belong to
different taxa), and H is Dkl standardized to account for within-community
diversity.

If an ultrametric phylogeny is supplied, Dkk is equivalent to the mean
pairwise phylogenetic distance (distance to MRCA) between two individuals
drawn from a community, Dkl is the mean pairwise phylogenetic distance
between individuals drawn from each of two communities, and H is Dkl
standardized to account for within-community diversity.

\emph{D\link{kl} = sum(t\link{ij} * x\link{ki} * x\link{lj})}

where \emph{x\link{ki}} is the relative abundance of taxon \emph{i} in community
\emph{k} and \emph{t\link{ij}} is a matrix of weights for all pairs of taxa
\emph{i,j}. Without a phylogeny, when \emph{i=j}, \emph{t\link{ij}=0}, otherwise
\emph{t\link{ij}=1}. With a phylogeny, \emph{t\link{ij}} is the phylogenetic distance
to MRCA for taxa \emph{i,j}.

\emph{H\link{kl} = D\link{kl} - (D\link{kk} + D\link{ll})/2}

Alpha, beta and total measure the average diversity within, among, and
across all communities based on Dkk and H values taking variation in number
of individuals per community into account. A Fst-like measure is calculated
by dividing beta by the total diversity across all samples.

\section{Warning }{
 Alpha, beta, and total diversity components and Fst
should not be interpreted as a measure of relative differentiation among
versus within communities. See Jost (2007) for a detailed description of
this problem. Hardy and Jost (2008) suggest Fst can be interpreted as
'local species identity excess' or 'local phylogenetic similarity excess'
rather than as a measure of among-community differentiation.
