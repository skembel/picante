\usage{
pcd(comm, tree, PSVmncd = NULL, PSVpool = NULL, reps = 10^4)
}
\arguments{
\item{comm}{Community data matrix}

\item{tree}{Object of class phylo or a phylogenetic covariance matrix}

\item{PSVmncd}{Vector of null mean conditional \emph{phylogenetic species
variability (\link[=psv]{PSV})} values}

\item{PSVpool}{The standard, unconditional \emph{PSV} calculated for the
species pool}

\item{reps}{The number of random draws from the species pool used to
produce \code{PSVmncd}}
}
\value{
The function returns a list with items:

\item{PCD}{ A square matrix of \emph{PCD} values } \item{PCDc}{ A square
matrix of \emph{PCDc} values } \item{PCDp}{ A square matrix of \emph{PCDp}
values } \item{PSVmncd}{ A vector of null mean conditional \emph{PSV}
values used to calculate \emph{PCD} } \item{PSVpool}{ The unconditional PSV
of the species pool used to calculate \emph{PCD} }
}
\description{
Pairwise dissimilarity in phylogenetic community composition that is
partitioned into a nonphylogenetic and a phylogenetic component.
}
\details{
\emph{Phylogenetic community dissimilarity (PCD)} is the pairwise
differences between communities derived by asking how much of the variance
among species in the values of a hypothetical nonselected trait in one
community can be predicted by the known trait values of species in another
community.  \emph{PCD} is partitioned into a nonphylogenetic component that
reflects shared species between communities (\emph{PCDc}) and a
phylogenetic component that reflects the evolutionary relationships among
nonshared species (\emph{PCDp}). In order to compare communities that vary
in species richness, the metric is standardized under the assumption that
the species in communities are selected at random from the species pool.
The analyses here define the species pool as the list of all species in the
set of communities in \code{comm}, but the species pool can be defined
under any hypothesis of community assembly either by manipulating the code
or inputting a user defined \code{PSVmncd} and \code{PSVpool}.
}
\note{
The sampling procedure used to standardize \emph{PCD} and produce
\code{PSVmncd} and \code{PSVpool} can be slow.
