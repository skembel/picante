\title{Null PhyloSor values of phylogenetic beta-diversity}
\usage{
phylosor.rnd(
  samp,
  tree,
  cstSor = TRUE,
  null.model = c("taxa.labels", "frequency", "richness", "independentswap", "trialswap"),
  runs = 999,
  iterations = 1000
)
}
\arguments{
\item{samp}{Community data matrix}

\item{tree}{Object of class phylo - a rooted phylogeny}

\item{cstSor}{TRUE if the Sorensen similarity should be kept constant
across communities. FALSE otherwise}

\item{null.model}{Null model to use (see Details section)}

\item{runs}{Number of randomizations}

\item{iterations}{Number of iterations to use for each randomization (for
independent swap and trial null models)}
}
\value{
A list of length the number of runs. Each element of the list is a
distance matrix containing the PhyloSor values of phylogenetic
beta-diversity obtained by randomization
}
\description{
PhyloSor values obtained by randomization for different choices of null
models
}
\details{
Currently implemented null models (arguments to null.model): \describe{
\item{taxa.labels}{ Shuffle community data matrix labels. Maintains species
richness in each community and species shared between communities. Should
be used with cstSor=TRUE} \item{frequency}{ Randomize community data matrix
abundances within species (maintains species occurence frequency). Does not
maintain species richness in communities nor species shared between
communities. Can only be used with cstSor=FALSE} \item{richness}{ With
cstSor=TRUE: For each pair of community, maintains species richness in each
community and species shared between communities. Sample in the species
pool with equal probability; With cstSor=FALSE: Maintains species richness
in each community, does not maintain species shared between communities.
Sample in the species pool with equal probability} \item{independentswap}{
Randomize community data matrix with the independent swap algorithm
(Gotelli 2000) maintaining species occurrence frequency and sample species
richness. Can only be used with cstSor=FALSE} \item{trialswap}{ Randomize
community data matrix with the trial-swap algorithm (Miklos & Podani 2004)
maintaining species occurrence frequency and sample species richness. Can
only be used with cstSor=FALSE} }
